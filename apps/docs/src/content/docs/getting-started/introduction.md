> *"More Geometrico"* - Design tokens for the age of superintelligence

SpinozaOS is a **philosophy-driven**, **motion-first** design system built for AGI-era applications. Born from the [Substance AGI Intelligence Engine](https://substance.mustafasarac.com), it provides award-winning design tokens, React components, and animation presets.

## Design Philosophy

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Prophetic Gold** | Single accent (#fbbf24) for mystical, future-focused aesthetic |
| **Void-first** | Deep black (#020617) foundation, dark-only |
| **Motion-first** | 60fps animations, spring physics, smooth interactions |
| **Information-dense** | Bloomberg Terminal inspired data visualization |
| **Mobile-first** | Touch targets, responsive from ground up |

## Design DNA

```
SpinozaOS = Bloomberg Terminal × Sci-Fi UI × Spinoza Philosophy
         = Data-driven + Mysterious + Philosophical
```
